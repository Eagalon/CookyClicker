Welcome to my cooky clicker game. This is nothing special. All you really do in this game is bake cookies and earn the highest rank you can get. The higher the rank you reach, the more money you earn when baking cookies. The money you've earned can be used to purchase various items in the shop, wich can help you throughout your baking journey.
Can you be the ultimate baker? Let's find out! Oh and also, for the love of god, don't you dare eat too many cookies. If you do, you'll get a not so pleasant surprise afterwords. Be careful!
